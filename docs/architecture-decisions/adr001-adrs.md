## Context

Users of the Extend APIs expect a stable and reliable API.

Large changes to the API should be communicated openly, with context available for users to understand why the change is needed and how it might affect them.

## Decision

We will document large changes to the API using ADRs in the Extend repository.

## Consequences

Large changes to the API have to be preceded by a published ADR.
